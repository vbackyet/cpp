//First, make a Zombie class. The zombies have a private name and are able to announce themselves like:
//<name> //BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ...Yes,announce( void )is a member function. Also, add a debugging message in the destructor including the name of the Zombie.
//After this, write a function that will create a Zombie, name it, and return it to be used somewhere else in your code. 
//The prototype of the function is: Zombie* newZombie( std::string name );
//You will also have to write another function that will create a Zombie, and make it announce itself. 
//The prototype of the function is:void randomChump( std::string name );
//Now the actual point of the exercise: your Zombies must be destroyed at the appro-priate time (when they are not needed anymore).
//They must be allocated on the stack or the heap depending on its use: sometimes
//itâ€™s appropriate to have them on the stack,at other times the heap may a better choice.
